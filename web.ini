# Configuration template for https://github.com/gradha/gh_nimrod_doc_pages.
#
# The gh_nimrod_doc_pages.ini file configures the multiple options
# which you would otherwise have to repeatedly type on the command
# line. All the options have to be provided inside a section (specified
# with brackets) with the same name as the tag/branch you want them
# to apply to. Since you are meant to run gh_nimrod_doc_pages from
# the gh-pages branch, use section [gh-pages] to set up the global
# options.
#
# Global options are used by default when options for a specific
# tag/branch are not found. You can use specific sections to override
# one or more parameters, though not all parameters are available out
# of the global section. If you specify paths in global options,
# the program will skip them if later some of them are not found when
# checking out a tag/branch, since maybe different versions have
# different files. However, specific tags/branches paths will halt
# generation if they are not found.
#
# The syntax for this .ini file is described at
# http://nimrod-lang.org/parsecfg.html (or your local Nimrod parsecfg
# module documentation). Since git tags/branches tend to have dashes,
# please quote the strings inside brackets of each section to avoid
# parsing problems.

["gh-pages"]

# The update_html parameter is only for gh-pages, it specifies the
# file that will be updated with the list of generated documentation.
# This parameter can't be empty.
update_html=index.html

# The doc_dir parameter is only for gh-pages, it specifies the path
# to the directory where generated documents will be placed. This
# parameter can't be empty.
doc_dir=gh_docs

# The ignore_tags parameter is only for gh-pages, it specifies the
# names of the tags that won't be processed. By default all available
# tags are processed. Use a triple quote multiline comment to specify
# one tag per line. You can use empty lines to separate tags visually.
#
# Since tags usually represent static snapshots of a git tree, if
# a tag has already been generated gh_nimrod_doc_pages will ignore
# it during a following run.

# The branches parameter is only for gh-pages, it specifies the
